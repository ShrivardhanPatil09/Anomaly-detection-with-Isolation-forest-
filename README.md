# 1 Anomaly Detection using Isolation Forest and Time Series Analysis

## Overview
This project explains two widely used techniques for detecting anomalies in datasets:

- Isolation Forest: Used for detecting outliers in structured, tabular data.
- Time Series Analysis: Used for identifying pattern breaks in time-based data.

## Isolation Forest

### What is it
Isolation Forest works by isolating data points. It splits features randomly and identifies points that get isolated quickly as potential anomalies.

### Best For
- Fraud detection such as unusual transactions
- Analyzing server logs
- Detecting outliers in tabular datasets

### How It Works
- Randomly selects features and values to split the dataset
- Points that require fewer splits to isolate are likely anomalies

### Example
Among one thousand transactions ranging from 500 to 5000, one transaction of 1000000 will be detected as an anomaly.

## Time Series Analysis

### What is it
Time Series Analysis looks at data that changes over time and identifies any values that deviate from normal patterns or trends.

### Best For
- Monitoring environmental data like temperature
- Website traffic or stock market changes
- Detecting sudden increases or drops over time

### How It Works
- Uses techniques like rolling mean or seasonal decomposition
- Flags data points that do not match expected time-based behavior

### Example
A spike from 500 to 5000 visitors in one day is detected as an anomaly in a website's daily traffic.

# 2 Host Behavior Profiling using KMeans Clustering

## Overview

This project applies KMeans clustering to analyze host behavior data in a network. The goal is to profile different types of host activity and detect groups of similar behavior. This technique can help identify typical usage patterns, as well as potentially unusual activity.

## What is KMeans Clustering

KMeans is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group data into K distinct clusters based on feature similarity. It works by assigning each data point to the cluster with the nearest centroid and then updating the centroids iteratively.

## Why Use KMeans for Host Profiling

- Helps group hosts with similar network behavior
- Identifies clusters that may correspond to normal, suspicious, or misconfigured behavior
- Simple and fast to apply to large datasets

## Dataset

The dataset contains host-level behavioral data, including features such as:

- Total connections made
- Number of distinct IPs accessed
- Amount of data sent and received
- Most used ports
- Activity time patterns

## Methodology

1. Preprocess the data (normalize features)
2. Choose the number of clusters using the Elbow method
3. Apply KMeans clustering
4. Analyze the characteristics of each cluster
5. Identify any unusual or interesting clusters

## Example Results

- Cluster 0: Normal users with average connections and data usage
- Cluster 1: High-traffic servers with large data transfers
- Cluster 2: Hosts with irregular patterns, possibly suspicious

## Requirements

- Python 3
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib or seaborn

# Time Series Modeling

## Overview

Time series modeling is used to analyze data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals. The goal is to understand patterns such as trend and seasonality, and to make forecasts about future values. Time series modeling is widely used in finance, economics, environmental studies, and network monitoring.

## What is Time Series Data

Time series data is a sequence of observations collected over time, typically ordered by date or timestamp. Examples include:

- Daily stock prices
- Hourly temperature readings
- Monthly sales numbers
- Network traffic logs

## Why Use Time Series Modeling

- Identify long-term trends
- Detect seasonal or cyclic patterns
- Forecast future values
- Detect anomalies or unusual behavior

## Common Techniques

1. **Moving Average and Rolling Statistics**  
   Used to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends.

2. **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**  
   A widely used model for time series forecasting that accounts for trend and seasonality.

3. **Exponential Smoothing**  
   Assigns more weight to recent observations while still considering past data.

4. **Seasonal Decomposition**  
   Separates the data into trend, seasonality, and residual components.

5. **LSTM and Deep Learning Models**  
   Neural networks for more complex, non-linear time series forecasting.

## Methodology

1. Collect and clean time series data
2. Visualize the data to check for trends and seasonality
3. Stationarize the data if needed (using differencing or transformations)
4. Fit an appropriate model (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM)
5. Validate the model using train-test splits
6. Forecast future values and analyze accuracy

## Example Applications

- Forecasting future stock or cryptocurrency prices
- Predicting website traffic
- Estimating energy consumption
- Monitoring network performance for anomalies

## Requirements

- Python 3
- pandas
- statsmodels
- matplotlib or seaborn
- scikit-learn
- (Optional) prophet or tensorflow/keras for advanced models
