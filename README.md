# 1 Anomaly Detection using Isolation Forest and Time Series Analysis

## Overview
This project explains two widely used techniques for detecting anomalies in datasets:

- Isolation Forest: Used for detecting outliers in structured, tabular data.
- Time Series Analysis: Used for identifying pattern breaks in time-based data.

## Isolation Forest

### What is it
Isolation Forest works by isolating data points. It splits features randomly and identifies points that get isolated quickly as potential anomalies.

### Best For
- Fraud detection such as unusual transactions
- Analyzing server logs
- Detecting outliers in tabular datasets

### How It Works
- Randomly selects features and values to split the dataset
- Points that require fewer splits to isolate are likely anomalies

### Example
Among one thousand transactions ranging from 500 to 5000, one transaction of 1000000 will be detected as an anomaly.

## Time Series Analysis

### What is it
Time Series Analysis looks at data that changes over time and identifies any values that deviate from normal patterns or trends.

### Best For
- Monitoring environmental data like temperature
- Website traffic or stock market changes
- Detecting sudden increases or drops over time

### How It Works
- Uses techniques like rolling mean or seasonal decomposition
- Flags data points that do not match expected time-based behavior

### Example
A spike from 500 to 5000 visitors in one day is detected as an anomaly in a website's daily traffic.

# 2 Host Behavior Profiling using DBSCAN Clustering

## Overview

Host behavior profiling is the process of analyzing the activity patterns of computers (hosts) in a network. The goal is to identify what constitutes normal behavior and to detect any hosts that behave suspiciously or abnormally. This technique is often used in network security to detect potential threats such as malware, insider attacks, or misconfigured machines.

## What is DBSCAN

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a clustering algorithm that groups data based on density. It identifies areas where data points are closely packed together and marks isolated points as outliers or noise. This makes it suitable for identifying abnormal behaviors in a network.

## Why Use DBSCAN for Host Profiling

- Does not require the number of clusters to be specified in advance
- Can detect outliers, which may indicate suspicious hosts
- Handles noise and irregular data well
- Works with non-linear patterns

## How It Works

1. Collect behavioral features for each host such as:
   - Number of connections
   - Bytes sent and received
   - Ports or services accessed
   - Time of activity

2. Standardize the feature values so that all dimensions contribute equally.

3. Apply DBSCAN clustering with two main parameters:
   - eps: The maximum distance between two points to be considered neighbors
   - min_samples: The minimum number of neighbors required to form a dense region

4. Interpret the clustering result:
   - Hosts that fall into a cluster share similar behavior and are considered normal
   - Hosts labeled as -1 are considered anomalies and may require further investigation

## Example Use Case

Consider a network with 100 hosts. Most of them access common services during office hours and show similar traffic patterns. However, a few hosts send large amounts of data at midnight or access unknown IP addresses.

Using DBSCAN:
- The normal hosts will be grouped into clusters
- The suspicious hosts will be flagged as noise or outliers

| Step               | Description                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Data Collection    | Capture behavioral metrics from each host        |
| Preprocessing      | Normalize or scale the data                      |
| Clustering         | Apply DBSCAN to group similar hosts              |
| Result Analysis    | Identify outliers as suspicious or abnormal hosts|
